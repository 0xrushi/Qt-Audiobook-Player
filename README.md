# Qt-Audiobook-Player

An audiobook player developed specifically for pinephone

## Why ?

Since linux phones on the rise, I couldn't find any Audiobook player applicaiton available. 

There is only one alternative **Cozy** mentioned here
https://www.reddit.com/r/pinephone/comments/lpg156/does_pinephone_have_a_good_audiobook_player/, but more than an audiobook player it looks like a music player with fancy thumbnails.


## Why is this special ?

- Open source
- Can bookmark important timestamps at any instant
- Can seek forward/ backward with custom timestamp, just change the `video_seek_duration` and `video_seek_faster_duration` in `ui_main.py`
- Works on desktops, laptops as well as linux phones :-) 

## Installation instructions

Install pyside2 
```
# for Arch linux
sudo pacman -S pyside2

python ui_main.py
```
